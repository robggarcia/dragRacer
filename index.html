      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" >Goal</h1>
      <p>The goal of this project was to design, program, and build a drag racing vehicle.  
          The vehicle was designed according to design specifications outlined in the 
          Project Assignment page found on our classroom Canvas page.  
          The goal of the vehicle was to race from a standstill across a 10 foot track and 
          cross the finish line in the fastest time.  
          Gears are necessary for a competitive design in order to increase the speed of 
          the provided TT motors.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" >Planning</h1>
      <p>I considered several different designs during the planning phase of my project.  
          This included different gear ratios, orientations, and layouts.  Although I had the 
          option to use two TT motors, I wanted to constrain my design to just using one in 
          order to minimize potential issues.  I initially wanted to use helical gears in 
          order to have my motor and rear axle spinning 90 degrees relative to each other.</p>
        <p>As I began creating my CAD model, I soon realized that this would be a very 
            difficult task.  As an alternative, I decided to design spur gears with teeth 
            at 45 degrees.  This would allow me to achieve a very similar effect to my 
            original idea, while still being able to take advantage of available feature 
            scripts in Onshape.</p>
        
        <p>Another design change that occurred during the planning phase involved what 
            gear ratio would be used.  I initially believed that I could achieve a 10:1
             gear ratio, however as I investigated this further I discovered the TT motor 
             would not have enough torque to spin the axle.  Therefore, in order to ensure 
             the successful completion of my drag racer, I chose a more conservative gear 
             ratio of 4:1.</p>
        <p>
        Here are some additional highlights from the planning phase of the design process.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drive Style: Two wheel rear drive.  Adjustable interface between Rear Axle and Drive Gear.</li>
            <li>Wheelbase: Four wheel design, including a free spinning front axle with two laser cut acrylic wheels.</li>
            <li>Gear Train: A single gear train made up of two gears spinning 90 degrees from each other.</li>
            <li>Gear Ratio: Final design includes a 4:1 ratio.</li>
            <li>Race Date: 5/27/2022. This date was firm. If I missed it, I would not be able to compete.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>This program was written on the Arduino IDE.  There were several sequences 
          that were required to occur before the race car would be allowed to start. 
           At the starting gate, the car would be placed on the ground and the photointerrupter
            would be blocked.  With the photointerrupter blocked, I would then be able to press
             a button to arm the car.  This button would not work unless the photointerrupter 
             was blocked.  Then, once the photointerrupter was opened up, the Arduino would 
             send a signal to the H-Bridge module to run both motors.  The time that the motors 
             run is adjustable from a trim-pot that I installed in the prototyping shield.</p>

      <p>This vehicle was created to be used as an example for students and fulfilled all 
          of the project requirements. It successfully raced down the track, with a fastest 
          recorded time of 4.32 seconds. The code allowed the racer to progress through each 
          step of the race, including turning on the vehicle, placing it in the starting gate,
           arming the vehicle, and racing. I encountered several problems along the way that 
           required additional thought or design changes.</p>
           <p>I initially designed my gear ratio to be 10:1. This would result in a top speed of 
        just over 6 meters/second. When I tested this design, I learned that the TT motors 
        do not have enough torque to start the vehicle moving at a 10:1 ratio. This required 
        a redesign down to a more conservative value of a 4:1 gear ratio. This updated design 
        worked well, but required significant updates to the CAD model. With the design changes 
        in place, the top speed of the vehicle dropped from 5 meters/second to just over 3 
        meters/second. Friction played a major role as well. Sanding the surfaces where the
         3D printed components meet such as between the axle and bearing blocks improved 
         performance.</p>
         <p>Overall I was very satisfied with my drag racer.  
        Although it does not go as fast as I initially hoped for, my design serves as a 
        good starting reference for students. If I were to do the project over again, 
        I would focus on designing a gearbox assembly that uses additional gears and 
        using simple laser cut acrylic spur gears that all rotate in the same plane.  
        These changes would result in a much faster racer that would be quicker to design and build.
